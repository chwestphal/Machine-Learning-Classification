# Machine-Learning-Classification
In this example I want to predict the "creditability" of the customers from the german_credit set.<br>
The dataset consists of 700 entries with a creditability of 1 and 300 entries with a creditability of 0.<br> 
If we built a predictor that always predicts 1, we would be right in 70% of the cases.<br> 
Therefore we have to divide the data into a test and training set and need to balance the entries.<br>
This was an exercise out of machine learning course where the data and the scaffold was given.<br>
